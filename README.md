# Dice app game with TDD

This is a simple dice game that is built following the core test driven development principles.

## Objectives

- Understand why we should use test driven development.
- Follow the test driven development process.
- Create a basic dice rolling program.

## Features

- Rspec files built up from the simplest principles.
- Die that can be rolled giving a result from 1-6.
- The ability to roll multiple dice.
- A record of each dice roll.
- A scoring system.

## Technologies used

- Ruby
- Rspec

## Conclusion

The dice roll game is another great tool for testing ones ability to perform test driven development. We started from writing the simplest of tests (Checking if a dice object is instanised) and built up complexity. Whilst the program itself is not complex, the TDD behind it is more complex than previous programs.
